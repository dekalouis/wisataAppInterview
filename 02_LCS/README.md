Find the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array of integers.

### Example
Input: `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`
Output: `4` (the longest consecutive sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`)

### Constraints
- The array may contain duplicate numbers
- The array will contain at least 2 consecutive integers
